# SixSuits Balatro Mod

## Description
This mod adds two new suits to the game: Stars and Moons. They work with any deck and can be toggled before starting a game, but they are not currently compatible with challenges. The new hand type Spectrum (5 cards of different suits) is introduced, including composite hands with Full Houses, Straights, and Five of a Kind. Spectrums are not affected by Four Fingers. Art by CrimsonHeart.
NEW in version 0.4: Custom jokers to fit the new suits have been introduced!

## How to install
This mod requires the [Steamodded Mod loader](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) at version 0.9.2 or higher. To install, download the zip file of the newest release and unzip it in the `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods` directory. Launch the game, and you should be good to go!
